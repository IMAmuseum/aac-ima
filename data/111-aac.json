Endowed with great natural ability as a painter and draughtsman, he soon turned to a full-time career as an artist, specializing in still life paintings. Carlsen was regarded second only to William Merritt Chase as America\u2019s leading still life painter, although he considered himself primarily a landscapist. He settled in San Francisco, where he was a close colleague of Arthur Matthews, the leader of the American Arts and Crafts Movement in California. Carlsen\u2019s style derived largely from the work of James Abbott McNeill Whistler, yet he added his own impressionist touch.<\/p>\n<p>The simplified setting and careful placement of the ceramics in this still life recall the work of eighteenth-century French artist Jean-Baptiste Sim\u00e9on Chardin. Carlsen\u2019s choice of Asian objects was probably inspired by Whistler, who was instrumental in spreading enthusiasm for Japanese aesthetics (called <em>japonisme<\/em>). Whistler also influenced Carlsen\u2019s spare, concentrated design and subdued harmonies of blue, white, and muted green.<\/p>\n<p>Carlsen, Emil. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/oclc\/48502950\"><em>The Art of Emil and Dines Carlsen<\/em>.<\/a> Southern Alleghenies Museum of Art, Altoona, Pennsylvania: Southern Alleghenies Museum of Art, 1977.<\/p>\n",

Steele was born in Gosport Indiana.\u00a0 His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art classes at age twelve.\u00a0 By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland Collegiate Institute. Steele moved to Indianapolis and cultivated a friendship with Herman Lieber, who became his patron.\u00a0 He studied at the Indiana School of Art with its founder John Love.\u00a0 Lieber raised the funds to send Steele and his family to Europe. Steele chose to go to Munich because it was less expensive than Paris and he could study with Frank Duveneck, a prominent Ohio painter.\u00a0 When Steele returned to Indianapolis, he established an art school with William Forsyth.\u00a0 He did portraits and landscapes, many of them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School.\u00a0 When he began to explore the Indiana countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting, and his work became more colorful and gradually more impressionistic.\u00a0 Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indiana\u2019s most important Impressionist painters, including William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle.\u00a0 In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco.\u00a0 In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home that became known as the House of the Singing Winds.<\/p>\n<p><em>Winter in <\/em>Munich features the road that connects the city to the village of Schleissheim, where Steele and his wife lived during much of their stay in Germany.\u00a0 Steele\u2019s wife recalled the path in winter:\u00a0 \u201cI look down through the long white vista; the trees seem to be all ablossom and they cast deep shadows as if it were summer.\u00a0 Their great branches, laden with feather fringes, droop over in long graceful curves\u2026\u201d\u00a0 The artist captures his wife\u2019s poetic view in this snow-covered vista lined with trees that stand like majestic figures n the white landscape.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reference<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>William H.
