This new type of suit became popular for striking a balance between comfort and elegance, which was a combination highly prized by American women.

They lifted their images from newspapers, magazines, television, and movies, the media through which most Americans received their daily dose of the visual arts.<\/p>\n<p>In 1962, Warhol painted thirty-two identical \"portraits\" of Campbell's soup cans, one for each available variety. These constituted his first one-man show. In 1967, when Warhol gave up painting and established a workshop called Factory Additions to produce prints, he turned again to Campbell's soup cans. Like the paintings, his twenty screen prints were identical in all ways except the varietal name.<\/p>\n<p>Like many of his fellow Pop artists, Warhol was a former commercial artist who knew that every label derives its appeal from the bedrock principles of color and design. By divorcing a soup can from the clutter of the pantry, magnifying it, rendering it in the lustrous colors of a screen print, and isolating it against a pristine white background, Warhol elevated this tossable commodity into a commanding American icon.<\/p>\n<blockquote><em>I knew Andy very well. The reason he painted soup cans is that he liked soup.<\/em><br \/>-Artist Robert Indiana, 2002<\/blockquote>",
