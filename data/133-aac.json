He was inspired by respect for their culture. Their seasonal, rural rituals of working in the irrigation ditches, planting, harvesting, and plastering their adobe homes fascinated him. He did portraits of both Indian and Spanish faces. There are lithographs of workers whose solid grace of gesture is the heritage of generations, passed along by rhythmic repetition, year in and year out. Adams portrayed them with monumentality. In the simplicity of their forms, there is a kinship with the Mexican muralist tradition of Orozco, Rivera, and Siqueiros, whom Adams much admired\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Adams\u2019 approach to the model was one of unsentimental truth-seeking, but his choice of models reveals his intense interest in their humble dignity. There are unforgettable faces painted by Adams. A suggestion of Cubism is seen in the faceted shapes within shapes. The Adams style matured in Taos. It was here that he wove his own combination of influences together with his taste and sensitivities, to create a mode in the middle ground between the academicism of the early Taos founders and the abstraction that stemmed from C\u00e9zanne and the Post-Impressionists.&quot;<\/p>\n<p>Nelson, Mary Carroll. \u201cKenneth Miller Adams: Cubism and Candor.\u201d In <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/title\/legendary-artists-of-taos\/oclc\/6331327&amp;referer=brief_results\"><em>The Legendary Artists of Taos<\/em><\/a>, edited by Mary Carroll Nelson (expanded from the pages of American Artist), 108-112.

Like other artists associated with Abstract Expressionism, Pousette-Dart felt that abstract painting could give form to universal myths and human truths. While the imagery embedded in the richly textured interlocking forms of <em>Eagle\u2019s Nest<\/em> is in many ways enigmatic, there are forms that suggest eyes and bird or animal body parts. This abstract imagery relates to a wide variety of sources, such as archaic pictographs, Native American and African art, as well as paintings by artists such as Pablo Picasso and Joan Mir\u00f3.<\/p>\n<p>During his career, Pousette-Dart created works that convey a belief in the idea of a collective unconscious, as posited in Carl Jung\u2019s theory of psychoanalysis that was very influential at the time. Jung\u2019s theory revolved around the notion that all human beings share innate psychic archetypes that govern human behavior. As he explained just a year after painting <em>Eagle\u2019s Nest<\/em>, \u201cI strive to express the spiritual nature of the universe. Painting for me is a dynamic balance and wholeness of life; it is mysterious and transcending, yet solid and real.\u201d<\/p>",

Bolted to the corner of a wall, this sculpture is suspended in a somewhat interstitial space of the gallery, rather than a more predictable position on the wall or floor. A sense of compression is conveyed in the bending shape of three stick-like forms, imparting a feeling that the corner of the room itself is somehow bearing pressure on this piece. Although this is simply an illusionary effect, it nevertheless succeeds in making viewers aware of the space around them in a new way by making space itself seem palpable. As Artschwager has described, his work proposes that sculpture can be \u201cfelt space.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>Corner<\/em> expresses Arthschwager\u2019s unique approach to sculpture, which is largely dominated by his desire to seek out unusual and unexpected materials and forms. He is particularly well-known for his use of Formica, a material that has been commonly used in building construction since the 60s, but is seen as a debased and resolutely non-art material. Here, he intentionally complicates the modernist ideal of purity of materials by employing painted wood as well as Formica. While the striated pattern appears to be natural oak wood-grain, upon closer inspection it becomes clear that this is an imitation of that natural form made in Formica. The artist deliberately emphasizes such ambiguity, and points to the fact that this often overlooked material of Formica offers a form of representation in its imitation of wood.<\/p>\n<p>In its placement and materials, Arthschwager\u2019s sculpture calls attention to its own forms of representation and how it functions in space. It also makes sly allusions to some of Pablo Picasso\u2019s famous challenges to artistic convention in the early 20th century, including his early sculptural constructions and his use of imitation wood-grain in his Cubist collages.<\/p>",

During stretching exercises, clients of the salon \"unfurled\" like the flowers in O'Keeffe's painting on the wall behind them. Arden paid O'Keeffe $10,000, considered an astonishing amount at the time, for the largest floral composition the artist would ever create.<\/p>\n<p>The four blossoms are placed in an energetic design that repeats the tight rhythm of the jimson weed's pinwheel-shaped flower. About this plant, which grew near the artist's home in New Mexico, O'Keeffe said, \"When I think of the delicate fragrance of the flowers, I almost feel the coolness and sweetness of the evening.\" She emphasized her subject's fresh beauty with a bright, simplified palette and rhythmic treatment of light and shadow.<\/p>\n<p>O'Keeffe, one of the first American modernists, was at the heart of the group of artists who gathered around Alfred Stieglitz, the photographer and art dealer who became her husband. The sheer size of her flowers-an arresting manipulation of scale-represented a radical modernist innovation.<\/p>\n<blockquote><em>I will make even busy New Yorkers take time to see what I see of flowers.<\/em><br \/>-Georgia O'Keeffe, 1939<\/blockquote>",

In 1905, she enrolled at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and, beginning in 1907, she attended the Art Students League in New York, studying there under William Merritt Chase. A drawing class taught by Alon Bement at the University of Virginia Summer School introduced O\u2019Keeffe to the work of Arthur Wesley Dow, whose progressive ideas influenced her art. O\u2019Keeffe began making compositions of highly magnified natural forms, which became her signature style. As a young girl, she was fascinated by the minute details of flowers, which she first painted in 1918. She produced her first \u2018close-up\u2019 flower paintings in 1924. O\u2019Keeffe said of these paintings, \u201cA flower is relatively small\u2026If I could paint the flower exactly as I see it no one would see what I see because I would paint it small like the flower is small. So I said to myself \u2013 I\u2019ll paint what I see \u2013 what the flower is to me but I\u2019ll paint it big and they will be surprised into taking time to look at it.\u201d \u201cMost people in the city rush around so, they have no time to look at a flower. I want them to see it whether they want to or not.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In 1936, cosmetics executive Elizabeth Arden commissioned O\u2019Keeffe to paint <em>Jimson Weed<\/em> to hang in the exercise room of the new Arden Sport Salon in New York. The result was the largest of O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s flower paintings. The artist placed the four blossoms in an exuberant design that repeats the tight rhythm of the pinwheel-shaped plant. She emphasized her subject\u2019s fresh beauty with a light, restricted palette. When Eli Lilly and Company purchased the Arden firm in the 1970s, it also acquired the painting. Lilly sold the Arden subsidiary in 1987 and they lent the painting to the Indianapolis Museum of Art at that time. The company ultimately donated it to the museum in 1997.<\/p>\n<p>O\u2019Keefe, Georgia and Nicholas Callaway. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/oclc\/15630362\"><em>One Hundred Flowers by Georgia O\u2019Keeffe<\/em>.<\/a> New York: Alfred A.
