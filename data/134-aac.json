He worked as a house painter and carpenter, but in 1840, he embarked on an artistic career and moved to Cincinnati. Duncanson was an itinerant painter until Nicholas Longworth, a wealthy Cincinnati landowner, commissioned him to paint murals at his personal residence, now the Taft Museum. The eight commissioned murals were large-scale landscapes with elaborate frames. Duncanson traveled to England and Europe several times. In England, he found favor with a group of abolitionist supporters. He also traveled to Scotland, exhibiting his work and making sketches that he used in later compositions. Upon his return from Scotland in 1867, Duncanson began a series of Scottish landscapes inspired by the writings of Sir Walter Scott. These picturesque views are considered to be the culmination of Duncanson\u2019s career.<\/p>\n<p>Duncanson painted <em>Loch Long<\/em> in 1867, shortly after he returned to America. His intention was to create a vision of the paradise denied him in his own country. In <em>Loch Long<\/em>, the panoramic landscape is illuminated in a serene light that reflects off the shimmering surface of the lake. The misty veil hovering in the background adds a dramatic element to this picturesque view.<\/p>\n<p>Ketner, Joseph D. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/oclc\/31405092\"><em>The Emergence of the African American Artist: Robert S.

A young girl listens wistfully as two elderly men play the flute and the clarinet. Leaning against the metronome is a music sheet indicating the tune's-and the painting's-title, \"The Love Song.\" Rockwell, an avid collector of antique maps, added an old map to the scene, enhancing its quaint setting.<\/p>\n<p>Rockwell was born in New York City and trained at the Chase School of Art, the National Academy of Design, and the Art Students League. In 1910, he set up a studio in New Rochelle, New York, the home of such famous illustrators as J.C. Leyendecker and his brother Frank, and Howard Chandler Christy. Rockwell was a young man of thirty-two when he was commissioned to paint <em>The Love Song, <\/em>yet he had already been designing cover illustrations for the <em>Saturday Evening Post<\/em> for a decade. Between 1916 and 1961, Rockwell illustrated more than three hundred covers for that magazine alone. He produced some of the most recognizable images in American art, always treating his subjects-\"average\" Americans in everyday situations-with warmth and humor. In his later years, Rockwell became more political. His 1965 illustration <em>The Problem We All Live With<\/em> dealt with segregated education in the United States.<\/p>\n<blockquote><em>Maybe . . . I unconsciously decided that, even if it wasn't an ideal world, it should be and so [I] painted only the ideal aspects of it.<\/em><br \/>-Norman Rockwell, 1960<\/blockquote>",

This work was created through a careful and laborious assemblage of cut paper and real plant leaves that are suspended in clear resin and painted with acrylic. His hybrid method is influenced by an array of art historical sources, including Persian miniatures, Buddhist mandalas, Rococo floral patterns, and 1960s psychedelic art.<\/p>\n<p>Tomaselli grew up in Southern California and moved to Brooklyn, New York, in the mid-1980s. Within this urban setting, he decided to cultivate a garden, and drew inspiration from the flora and fauna he found there. At times, he inserted materials such as plant leaves from his garden into his collage-paintings. He was also attracted to the birds that flocked to the garden, and used the colorful images of birds from field guide books as another source for his artworks. Birds are among the most important symbols in his work, not only for their colorful nature but because they are metaphors for the flight of the unconscious mind.<\/p>\n<p>Taking these elements drawn from nature, he places them in complex configurations that suggest decorative patterning, cosmic maps or even psychedelic hallucinations. Tomaselli\u2019s work offers an intriguing meditation on the nexus of nature and artifice.<\/p>",

Broad circular areas of yellow, blue, red, and green paint in the upper and middle portions of the canvas suggest bright flowers popping up through a thick blanket of white snow. Painting the canvas in an upright position, Mitchell allowed the wet paint to drip toward the floor, creating long vertical streaks throughout the composition. Both the dynamic brushstrokes and the vertical patterns of dripping paint reveal the presence of the artist by alerting the viewer to the physical act of painting.<\/p>\n<p>During the 1950s, Mitchell, a second-generation Abstract Expressionist, participated actively in the New York art world, showing her work in important exhibitions at the Stable Gallery. She frequented the Cedar Bar, a famous meeting place for artists and writers, where she befriended Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline, who, along with the early modernists Paul C\u00e9zanne and Vincent van Gogh, became crucial influences on her work. In 1959, after living between New York and France for several years, Mitchell moved permanently to the French village of V\u00e9theuil. Her extensive gardens there provided endless inspiration for her paintings.<\/p>\n<blockquote><em>I do not want to improve [Nature]. . . . I could certainly never mirror it.

Among his students were John Washington Love and William Merritt Chase.\u00a0 Much of his renown came from his ability to convince Chase\u2019s father to allow his son to continue his studies in New York City.\u00a0 Hays was successful in receiving the commission to paint governor William Harrison\u2019s portrait.\u00a0 He was one of the original members of the Art Association of Indianapolis, the founders of the Indianapolis Museum of Art.<\/p>\n<p>The Sewells, residents of Covington, Indiana, were painted using the dark tonalities and unadorned background typically found in nineteenth-century portraiture.\u00a0 The meticulous rendering of the sitters\u2019 glasses, the careful delineation of William Sewell\u2019s thinning hair and full beard and Eusebia Sewell\u2019s delicate lace collar with its prominent cameo pin exemplify the quality and attention to detail typical of Hays\u2019 portrait style.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reference<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Mary Burnet. <em>Art and Artists of Indiana<\/em>, Roswell, GA: Whippoorwill Publications, 1985.\u00a0<strong>ISBN-13:<\/strong> 978-1443773805<\/p>",

Here, he employed a mix of found objects and common household materials\u2014including twist ties, craft wood, staples, and packing material\u2014which he transformed almost alchemically into a complex and awe-inspiring sculpture.<\/p>\n<p>Echoing the working methods of ship-in-a-bottle hobbyists, Hawkinson created a painstakingly detailed model ship that twists in upon itself, presenting the viewer with a thought-provoking visual conundrum. The title is a witty play on Herman Melville\u2019s novel <em>Moby Dick<\/em>, which famously relates the tale of a ship captain\u2019s all-consuming obsession with an elusive white whale. The ambitious and imaginative structure of Hawkinson\u2019s sculpture offers an uncanny visual metaphor for Melville\u2019s epic tale, which is often considered the ultimate American novel.<\/p>\n<p><em>M\u00f6bius Ship<\/em> also humorously refers to the mathematical concept of the M\u00f6bius Strip. Named after a nineteenth-century astronomer and mathematician, the M\u00f6bius Strip is a surface that has only one side, and exists as a continuous curve. Its simple yet complex spatial configuration presents a visual puzzle that parallels Hawkinson\u2019s transformation of the mundane materials into something unexpected.<\/p>",

These four works were created in 1980 during the artist\u2019s six month stay in Berlin on a grant from the German Academic Exchange Service. There, Antonakos assembled collages from color-printed paper, each of which he considered to function like a page in a book.

In the November 1974 issue of <em>Artforum<\/em> magazine, Benglis infamously took out an advertisement displaying a photograph of herself naked except for sunglasses, in an assertive pose, holding a dildo to her pelvis. She described the advertisement as an attempt to make sense of the feminist movement of the 1970s and \u201cto mock the idea of having to take sexual sides\u2014to be either a male artist or a female.\u201d In this Polaroid photo collage from the year following her <em>Artforum<\/em> appearance, Benglis\u2019s focus is on photographing men, of whom she says, \u201cthey were my \u2018objects\u2019.\u201d<\/p>",

In the present work, he created luminous veils of off-white pigment by soaking thinned oil paint into the canvas, employing a variation on the stain technique that artists such as Helen Frankenthaler also used. A subtle architectural reference is visible at the top, where he creates beam-like forms. Poet John Ashbery aptly described his work as \u201cpart air, part architecture.\u201d<\/p>",

He also studied at the National Academy of Design and trained under Robert Henri. At this time, he met Stuart Davis, who would remain a lifelong friend. Fisk later went to Paris, where he continued his studies at the Acad\u00e9mie Moderne. During his year in Paris, he became part of the avant-garde, attending evening gatherings at the home of Gertrude and Leo Stein. Fisk continued his interest in modernism after his return. He often visited Alfred Stieglitz\u2019s gallery, where he saw exhibitions of the most important avant-garde artists. Fisk never achieved the reputation of his colleagues. He taught at the University of Kentucky while trying to gain recognition as a modern artist.<\/p>\n<p><em>Rooftops<\/em> is composed of sharp lines, geometric shapes, and flat blocks of color, all of which characterize the formal aesthetic of Precisionism. Precisionism was influenced by industrial development such as skyscrapers and factories. The contrast of light and shadow creates a strikingly dramatic effect in this architectural portrait. This particular subject matter is unusual in Fisk\u2019s <em>oeuvre<\/em>. Most of his works represent the farms and towns of Kentucky and Vermont.<\/p>\n<p>Sadinsky, Rachel, William G.

These fragile drawings, whose delicate pencil markings are as tenuous as the paper on which they sit, have been stored since the late 1970s in this book handmade by the artist. Faint outlines can be seen on the higher quality book paper, where the low grade newsprint has discolored the paper around it. Also visible are the artist\u2019s notations of the order of the drawings and a number corresponding to Dorothy Vogel\u2019s system for cataloguing the works.<\/p>",

These fragile drawings, whose delicate pencil markings are as tenuous as the paper on which they sit, have been stored since the late 1970s in this book handmade by the artist. Faint outlines can be seen on the higher quality book paper, where the low grade newsprint has discolored the paper around it.

                    "content": "<p>In Indianapolis during the spring of 2008, Allison Smith produced a commissioned project for the IMA\u2019s exhibition and art parade <em>On Procession<\/em>. Working with students at the Herron School of Art and Design, Smith created three large-scale wooden pull-toys\u2014<em>The Donkey, The Jackass, and The Mule<\/em>. Taking the exhibition theme as a prompt, Smith began thinking about the procession of Jesus riding a donkey through the gates of Jerusalem as a peace gesture. The sculptures developed layered meanings during construction as they were informed by various references, including the donkey as a symbol of the Democratic Party and the Reconstruction-era promise of \u201cforty acres and a mule\u201d to freed slaves. <br \/><br \/>The performance of this work included a collaboration with Freetown Village, a living history organization dedicated to the depiction of African American life in Indianapolis in 1870. Wearing period dress, members of Freetown Village performed a reenactment of a suffragist protest, which was a re-creation of a performance the group staged in the 1980s during Jesse Jackson\u2019s presidential campaign. Focusing on the voting rights of African Americans and women, the performance was rewritten for the context of 2008 Indiana. The rally began at Fountain Square, followed by a mass movement onto Virginia Avenue, where participants pulled the sculptures and marched alongside them. Performers chanted the slogan \u201cCast that vote!\u201d and sang songs such as \u201cAin\u2019t Gonna Study War No More.\u201d Some carried placards bearing slogans connecting the past to the present, with references to the Civil War, the Civil Rights Movement, and the 2008 presidential elections. Smith worked with photographer Michelle Pemberton to record the participants on parade day. \u00a0<br \/><br \/><em>The Donkey, The Jackass, and The Mule<\/em> continues Smith\u2019s sculptural work in scaled-up 19th-century toys, which have included porcelain dolls, wooden rifles, and a hobby horse. Smith\u2019s multimedia installations, from battle encampments to period rooms, are steeped in her investigation of living history. \u201cAt its worst, reenactment can be read as a metaphor for the relentless replay and reification of the same old master narratives. But at its best, living history also suggests the unfixed and contested nature of history itself, and our potential role as active agents within it,\u201d says Smith.<\/p>",

Dove was a core member of the Stieglitz Group, a small circle of American artists dedicated to modernism, who regularly exhibited at Stieglitz\u2019s New York City galleries. Dove made his home on a farm in Westport, Connecticut, and established himself as one of the first abstract artists. His goal was to represent nature in a very personal way, capturing its essences and nuances in an abstract manner. He moved with his future wife and fellow artist, Helen Torr, to a houseboat on the Harlem River from 1924 to 1933. During these years, his work focused on his environment and included boats, barges, and docks. For five years, he lived on his family\u2019s farm in Geneva, where his subjects were inspired by the rural environment.<\/p>\n<p>Painted during the period when Dove abandoned representation altogether, <em>Reflections<\/em> contains all of the characteristic elements of his work.

Both artists, who later became associated with the Washington Color School, visited New York City in 1953; there they saw Helen Frankenthaler's stain paintings and began experimenting with similar techniques. In 1958, Noland started working on his abstract concentric-circle paintings, sometimes referred to as targets. With the unprimed, unsized, square canvas placed directly on the floor, Noland would find its center and work outward. First he drew in pencil around plates and hoops, then filled in the concentric circles with intense acrylic colors, often diluted to ensure an even saturation of the paint. In 1959, the gallery French and Company in New York City showed fifteen of these pulsating works in a solo exhibition that critics, including the noted modernist Clement Greenberg, overwhelmingly praised.<\/p>\n<p><em>Fall Blues<\/em> is one of Noland's later circle works. The central red form is surrounded by a narrow ring of unprimed canvas, followed by a wider ring of translucent layers of blue and red paint. Unlike the earlier works, in which Noland left the canvas bare around the edges, this painting displays circles completely surrounded by a broad field of dark blue paint, creating the appearance of a celestial body hovering in a dark autumn sky.<\/p>\n<blockquote><em>His color counts by its clarity and its energy; it is not there neutrally, to be carried by the design and the drawing; it does the carrying itself.<\/em><br \/>-Art critic Clement Greenberg, 1960<\/blockquote>",

The seventeenth-century Dutch master Johannes Vermeer was his primary influence, especially for his figure studies. In addition to easel paintings, Paxton produced murals, lithographs, and etchings in his Boston, East Gloucester, and Provincetown studios. He became a member of the National Academy of Design in 1928. Paxton was equally famous for his portraiture and figure studies of upper class women at leisure.<\/p>\n<p><em>Girl Sweeping<\/em> depicts a member of another stratum of society, the working class. This intimate painting, which is reminiscent of Jean-Sim\u00e9on Chardin\u2019s figure painting, is a smaller version of a work executed in 1912. Both compositions are very similar except for a rearrangement of furniture and the addition of the cap in the Indianapolis version, which more readily defines the figure as a servant. It is not unusual for Paxton to include servants tending to the luxurious spaces of the upper class.<\/p>\n<p>Lee, Ellen Wardwell, R. H. Ives Gammel, Martin F.

C. Steele was born in Gosport Indiana.\u00a0 His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art classes at age twelve.\u00a0 By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland Collegiate Institute. Steele moved to Indianapolis and cultivated a friendship with Herman Lieber, who became his patron.\u00a0 He studied at the Indiana School of Art with its founder John Love.\u00a0 Lieber raised the funds to send Steele and his family to Europe. Steele chose to go to Munich because it was less expensive than Paris and he could study with Frank Duveneck, a prominent Ohio painter.\u00a0 When Steele returned to Indianapolis, he established an art school with William Forsyth.\u00a0 He did portraits and landscapes, many of them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School.\u00a0 When he began to explore the Indiana countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting, and his work became more colorful and gradually more impressionistic.\u00a0 Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indiana\u2019s most important Impressionist painters, including William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle.\u00a0 In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco.\u00a0 In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home that became known as the House of the Singing Winds.<\/p>\n<p><em>Sunrise<\/em><em> <\/em>was made from sketches Steele produced while studying abroad and is the only known Munich scene painted after Steele returned from Germany.\u00a0 The depiction of a single figure on a tree-lined road is similar to Steele\u2019s sketches of the Road to Schleissheim in his Munich sketchbooks.\u00a0 The purple clouded sky in <em>Sunrise<\/em><em> <\/em>can be seen in some of Steele\u2019s paintings of Schleissheim. <em>Sunrise<\/em> suggests nostalgia for the Munich landscape that remained with Steele after his return to Indiana.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reference<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>William H.

One of his signature forms is the curved line, which he uses to create a sense of flowing movement that unifies his compositions.

As he has explained, \u201cIn the painting the edge can simply be where the work ends, or, conversely, where it begins.\u201d<\/p>",

The Scott Paper Company introduced the first paper dress in 1966 as a promotional item and sold about 500,000 dresses. The success of the dresses was so phenomenal that many other companies started making them. The disposable dresses came in four sizes, and alterations and repairs were made with transparent tape. The hem could be adjusted simply with a pair of scissors.<\/p>\n<p>A symbol of the throwaway culture of the '60s, paper dresses were marketed for mass consumption and were available in numerous styles and prints. By 1967, major department stores such as I. Magnin &amp; Co, Lord &amp; Taylor, and Altman's, were selling them.<\/p>\n<p>Many of the dresses were printed in geometric, abstract motifs inspired by the Op art, Conceptual art and Pop art movements. Paper dresses unified art and fashion as they became part of the developing popular culture of the 1960s.<\/p>\n<p>This A-line dress is constructed from four layers of very thin tissue-like paper bonded by pressure. All paper dresses were treated with fire-resistant chemicals and were not to be washed or dry cleaned, which would have made them flammable.<\/p>\n<p>The paper dresses of the late 1960s were throwaways, often used in political campaigns and for advertising and other commercial uses.<\/p>",

Sternfeld composed the accompanying label to explain the history of this location.<br \/><br \/><strong>Roofless Church<\/strong><br \/>In the early 1800s, Robert Owen, a wealthy industrialist, took on the role of social theorist after radically improving labor conditions at a Scottish mill while increasing profits. New Lanark was famous throughout Europe because the minimum working age had been raised to ten, a form of health insurance was initiated, and working hours were shorter than at other mills. Owen came to believe that by changing the conditions of people\u2019s lives it was possible to change their character, and that the final aim of character formation should be happiness. Happiness, he held, \u201cwill be the only religion of man.\u201d He and other similar thinkers of the time were referred to as socialists because they had a theory of society.<br \/><br \/>The opportunity for Owen to put his theories into practice came in 1824, when he purchased the entire town of Harmony, Indiana, and turned it into America\u2019s first secular utopian experiment. But what had worked in a narrow and isolated mill valley in Scotland did not work in the United States. Despite the participation of prominent scientists and of Owen\u2019s four highly educated sons, the experiment failed. There were many reasons: the purchase of a ready-made town did not allow members to gain the shared satisfaction and unity of purpose that might have come by building from scratch; deep disagreements churned between Owen and American co-founder William Maclure over education (leading some to dub the town \u201cNew Discord\u201d); and the frontier farmers and mechanics who responded to Owen\u2019s invitation to join a new \u201ccommunity of equals,\u201d took him at his word, and resented the \u201cuppity\u201d standards of speech, table manners and courtly rituals imposed upon them by the leaders. Despite the brevity of its life as a formal experiment, New Harmony proved highly influential throughout the nineteenth century. Without a community against which they might be measured, Owen\u2019s ideas could stand for general reformist principles and they did.<br \/><br \/>The Roofless Chapel was commissioned by Jane Blaffer Owen, widow of a descendent of Robert Owen, and designed by architect Philip Johnson in 1960 to echo the mark left by New Harmony as a place of inspiration. Johnson\u2019s concept was that only one roof\u2014the sky\u2014can encompass all worshipping humanity. The dome was built in the form of an inverted rosebud, tying it to the New Harmony Community of Equals, whose symbol was the rose.<\/p>",

During his time in Nara, Japan, Gummer became influenced by Japanese architecture and decoration, in particular the structure of traditional folding screens and patterning of Tatami floor mats. After being injured in a motorcycle accident, Gummer was briefly hospitalized at Lanna Hospital in Chiang Mai, Thailand, where he drew the initial sketches for <em>Nara and Lanna<\/em>.

Carefully attuned to the innate sculptural properties of these typically non-art materials, Donovan draws on their specific characteristics in often surprising ways. The resulting configurations evoke a sense of expansive growth, as well as natural phenomena such as ripples, clouds, haze and undulating landscapes, transcending the mundane qualities of the materials of which they are composed.\n\nDonovan's drawings engage in an important dialogue with the processes explored in her installations. She uses materials such as rubber bands, bubbles and shattered glass to create abstract drawings that suggest traces of these three-dimensional elements. Both her sculptural installations and drawings provoke viewers to think about materiality in new ways.\n\nTara Donovan, Untitled (Mylar), 2010.

McElheny sees this display system as the pinnacle of modern design and made a replica, which he outfitted with glass panels and arranged within it a selection of glass objects in blue, yellow and red. An expert glassblower, McElheny hand-fabricated the vessels on display, whose designs are based on mid-century Czech, Italian, and Scandinavian glassware. In his novel assemblages of metal and exquisitely crafted glass, McElheny strikes a contrast between mass production and the handmade.\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/p>",
