Here, Tuttle employed grooved wood that is typically used for stretchers and frames for paintings to create a highly dynamic sculptural form. He likewise freed canvas from its typical constraints and used it as a three-dimensional element in his composition, with freely brushed paint further enlivening its surface.<\/p>\n<p>By engaging with the space that surrounds it, <em>Six<\/em> encourages the viewer to see this space in a new way.<\/p>",

Among his students were John Washington Love and William Merritt Chase.\u00a0 Much of his renown came from his ability to convince Chase\u2019s father to allow his son to continue his studies in New York City.\u00a0 Hays was successful in receiving the commission to paint governor William Harrison\u2019s portrait.\u00a0 He was one of the original members of the Art Association of Indianapolis, the founders of the Indianapolis Museum of Art.<\/p>\n<p>Hay\u2019s likeness of Dr. Lyons is typical of early American portraits.\u00a0 The seated half-length figure is placed against a plain background.\u00a0 His hands and face are emphasized by contrasting the skin tones and the white shirt against the dark setting.\u00a0 Facial features are carefully rendered in firm brushstrokes.\u00a0 The sitter holds a book on his lap as a symbol of higher learning and his own accomplishments.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reference<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Mary Burnet. <em>Art and Artists of Indiana<\/em>, Roswell, GA: Whippoorwill Publications, 1985.\u00a0<strong>ISBN-13:<\/strong> 978-1443773805<\/p>",

Consisting of five separate elements, the tallest of which soars 40 feet into the air, Five Brushstrokes features a striking collection of forms and colors and is one of Lichtenstein\u2019s premier \u2018scatter pieces\u2019. Installed on The Dudley and Mary Louise Sutphin Mall in front of the main museum building, Five Brushstrokes will be a prominent new addition to the IMA\u2019s celebrated outdoor sculpture program and an awe-inspiring welcome to IMA visitors.",

After some success as a violinist, he decided to study art in Paris at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian. There, he met Joseph Henry Sharp, who told him about the marvelous landscape of New Mexico. Both artists eventually travelled west and helped found the Taos Art Colony in Taos, New Mexico. Blumenschein and his artist-wife Mary Shepard Greene both taught at the Pratt Institute. Every summer, Blumenschein would go to Taos to paint the landscape. He eventually moved his family to New Mexico where he remained for the rest of his life. Blumenschein became one of the more well known of the Taos painters and won numerous awards. During the early part of his career, Blumenschein divided his time between New York and Europe, creating canvases very different from his depictions of Taos.<\/p>\n<p><em>Portrait of a German Tragedian<\/em> is one of Blumenschein\u2019s early paintings. The subject, with its memorable face and figure, was painted in Paris in 1907 and exhibited at the Salon of 1908, where it was viewed and subsequently purchased by Indiana author Booth Tarkington. Many years later, the artist reminisced about the subject of this work, \u201cThe \u2018German Tragedian\u2019 was an Austrian actor in real life, stranded in Paris, posing between jobs for a few painters. He was a reciter of verse I discovered while he was posing for me in our Salon at Boul(evard) Raspail.\u201d The actor\u2019s rotund form is agilely perched upon a delicate French bench, while his dark suit and heavy coat contrast with the subtly striped backdrop. One look at the portly actor\u2019s expressive right hand, exquisitely painted, reveals that Blumenschein had clearly absorbed the French curriculum of draftsmanship and modeling.<\/p>\n<p>Hassrick, Peter H. and Elizabeth J.

In 1830, Cox and his brother established a tinsmith shop, first in Pittsburgh and later in Indianapolis.\u00a0 The business prospered forcing Cox to pursue his painting during his spare time.\u00a0 By 1835 painting portraits was added to Cox\u2019s business. Cox closed his shop and traveled to Cincinnati to study with John Dunn, returning to Indianapolis to paint portraits of such local notables as Senator Oliver Smith, Governors David Wallace and Noah Noble, State Treasurer Samuel Merrill, and numerous prominent businessmen and their families. His success enabled Cox to travel to New York City to study briefly at the National Academy of Design.\u00a0 Upon his return, he found time to add landscapes and still life to his repertoire.\u00a0 When the Indiana School of Art was established in Indianapolis in 1877, Cox became one of its teachers.\u00a0 He continued to paint and exhibit until his death at eighty one.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Cox\u2019s portrait of Charles H. Brewer hung in his son Charles\u2019s home for fifty-five years before it was offered as a gift to the IMA.\u00a0 The family recounts that the elder Brewer was about twelve years old when Cox painted him.\u00a0 According to Brewer\u2019s son, the artist finished the painting in his studio, added the fishing rod and dog, which did not belong to the sitter.\u00a0 Such attributes, including the imaginary landscape in the background, were common practices in nineteenth century portraiture and served to enhance the sitter\u2019s status or, in this case, add to the image of a childhood.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reference<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Paintings by Jacob Cox a Retrospective Exhibition of Work by an Early Indianapolis Artist<\/em>, Indianapolis: John Herron Art Museum, 1941. <strong>ASIN:<\/strong> B001O1F2TS<\/p>",

In 1835 he took up residence in Cincinnati, Ohio. Upon hearing of the plight of northern Indiana\u2019s Potawatomi Indians, who were being removed to Kansas in what became known as \u201cPotawatomi Trail of Death,\u201d Winter settled in Logansport, Indiana to document their culture.\u00a0 After thirteen years in Logansport, he moved to Lafayette, Indiana, and then spent three years in California.\u00a0 Shortly after his return to Indiana in 1876, Winter died suddenly. Although he is known primarily for documenting the relocation of the Potawatomi and Miami tribes, Winter was a writer whose prose not only convey the anguish of the relocation but also the beauty of the surrounding countryside. Winter is also known for his documentation of the life of Frances Slocum, a Quaker child who was abducted by Indians and later became the wife of the tribe\u2019s chief.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The IMA collection contains several paintings by George Winter two of which are titled <em>Scene on the Wabash<\/em>.\u00a0 Both of these works portray a group of Potawatomi Indians gathered next to the Wabash River.
