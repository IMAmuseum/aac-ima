His early use of the family\u2019s walls as a drawing board convinced his parents that their son need a specific space to express his creativity.\u00a0 When he was ten, his family moved to Versaille, Indiana and then to Indianapolis.\u00a0 Forsyth started his art studies with Barton Hays when he was fifteen.\u00a0 He earned his living painting houses with his brother and used his free time to explore his artistic talents.\u00a0 Forsyth became the first student in the newly established Indiana School of Art and later worked as an assistant instructor at the school.\u00a0 His desire for more formal training led Forsyth to follow his friend Theodore Clement Steele to Munich to study at the Royal Academy. During the summer he traveled around Europe and sent the paintings he completed during these trips home to sell at exhibitions.\u00a0 When Forsyth finished his studies, he stayed in Europe for another two years then returned to Indiana and set up a school in Muncie with J. Ottis Adams.\u00a0 After the school closed, Forsyth joined the faculty of the newly opened John Herron Art Institute where he worked from 1906 to 1933.\u00a0 Well into his seventies, but not prepared emotionally or financially for retirement, Forsyth took commissions from the Public Works Administration, which had been established to help artists during the Depression.\u00a0 In 1934 Forsyth had a heart attack and died a year later.<\/p>\n<p>Old peasant types were the favored models in Ludwig von L\u00f6fftz\u2019s Technical Painting Class.\u00a0 One of his pupils remarked: \u201cRuins of mankind, we used to call them. We scrutinized their faces and tried to render the studies in a grayish-green tone.\u00a0 We called such work \u2018good in tone\u2019.\u201d Here Forsyth\u2019s soft, shadowy grays are relieved only by the sharp details that emerged from the highlights.\u00a0 Though many students chafed under L\u00f6fftz\u2019s disdain for spontaneous and colorful effects, according to Forsyth, they later acknowledged that the discipline had been worthwhile and recognized L\u00f6fftz as \u201cthe greatest teacher of painting in Germany.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reference<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Martin Krause.\u00a0 <em>The Passage: Return of Indiana Painters from Germany, 1880-1905<\/em>, Indianapolis: Indianapolis Museum of Art, 1990.\u00a0 <strong>ISBN<\/strong> 00-936260-52-1\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>",

Richards, however, found the work distasteful and left to open his own portrait painting studio in Franklin, Indiana.\u00a0 He married and moved to Anderson, Indiana where he found employment as a newspaper illustrator. To enable him to travel abroad to pursue an academic art education, Richards raised money among his patrons in Anderson on the promise of repayment in pictures.\u00a0 Richards traveled to Munich, Germany to attend the Royal Academy where he would learn to draw and paint portraits and figure studies using local models.\u00a0 Richards copied Old Master Paintings in Munich\u2019s Alte Pinakothek to send back to his Indiana patrons.\u00a0 While in Europe Richards contracted tuberculosis and was forced to return to the United States, where he took up residence in Colorado.\u00a0 His career was cut short when he died of his illness at the age of forty-three.<\/p>\n<p>At the Royal Academy, Professor von L\u00f6fftz\u2019s perfectionism was legendary. Emphasizing the dark tonalities of the Old Dutch Masters, he demanded that his students restrict their palettes to carefully modulated browns, ochres, grays, and off-whites with the intention of reigning in impulses toward harsh local colors.\u00a0 His policy of reducing color to a narrow range of harmonies drove the more impulsive students to distraction.\u00a0\u00a0 A Swiss artist complained: \u201cIn my study of that woman I was well on my way to losing the color altogether as I continually tried to subdue the tone toward gray.\u201d\u00a0 Such struggles are evident in Richards\u2019s portraits with their emphasis on dark tonalities devoid of high key color.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reference<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Martin Krause.\u00a0 <em>The Passage: Return of Indiana Painters from Germany<\/em>, <em>1880-1905<\/em>, Indiana: Indianapolis Museum of Art in cooperation with Indiana University Press, 1991. <strong>ISBN: <\/strong>0-036260-52<\/p>",

His early use of the family\u2019s walls as a drawing board convinced his parents that their son need a specific space to express his creativity.\u00a0 When he was ten, his family moved to Versaille, Indiana and then to Indianapolis.\u00a0 Forsyth started his art studies with Barton Hays when he was fifteen.\u00a0 He earned his living painting houses with his brother and used his free time to explore his artistic talents.\u00a0 Forsyth became the first student in the newly established Indiana School of Art and later worked as an assistant instructor at the school.\u00a0 His desire for more formal training led Forsyth to follow his friend Theodore Clement Steele to Munich to study at the Royal Academy. During the summer he traveled around Europe and sent the paintings he completed during these trips home to sell at exhibitions.\u00a0 When Forsyth finished his studies, he stayed in Europe for another two years then returned to Indiana and set up a school in Muncie with J. Ottis Adams.\u00a0 After the school closed, Forsyth joined the faculty of the newly opened John Herron Art Institute where he worked from 1906 to 1933.\u00a0 Well into his seventies, but not prepared emotionally or financially for retirement, Forsyth took commissions from the Public Works Administration, which had been established to help artists during the Depression.\u00a0 In 1934 Forsyth had a heart attack and died a year later.<\/p>\n<p>By 1881 modeling was an established profession in Munich.\u00a0 Models were in demand not only by the Academy but also by the hundreds of independent artists working in the city.\u00a0 Some professional models were painted as monks and possessed Carmelite cowls, which they brought with them to the artists\u2019 studios.\u00a0 Here Forsyth\u2019s model, with his bald head, flowing beard and robe, has the appropriate features and attire to make the ideal monk.\u00a0 The light falls on the bent head of the man, who emerges from the deep shadow with his hands clasped in prayer.\u00a0 The isolated figure in Forsyth\u2019s dark, unadorned interior expresses religious devotion in the dramatic, theatrical style promoted by the Royal Academy.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reference<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Martin Krause.\u00a0 <em>The Passage: Return of Indiana Painters from Germany, 1880-1905<\/em>, Indianapolis: Indianapolis Museum of Art, 1990.\u00a0 <strong>ISBN<\/strong> 00-936260-52-1\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>",

Reifel by her Heirs<\/p>\n<p><strong>Learn More<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>J. Ottis Adams was born in Amity, Indiana and settled with his family in Shelbyville, Indiana.\u00a0 The young Adams was fascinated with art and spent much of his time drawing. He enrolled in Wabash College but left a year later to study art at the South Kensington School in London where he came under the influence of John Constable and Joseph Mallord William Turner, whose landscapes were of particular interest to Adams.\u00a0 He returned to Indiana and settled in Muncie.\u00a0 In 1880, Adams traveled to Munich to study at the Royal Academy with fellow Indiana artists Theodore Clement Steele and Samuel Richards.\u00a0 Adams studied drawing and painting at the Academy and then set up his own studio in Munich.\u00a0 When he returned to Indiana in 1887, Adams set up a studio in Muncie and began teaching art classes.\u00a0 In 1889, he and fellow artist William Forsyth opened the Muncie Art School, which lasted two years. Adams participated in a group show of Hoosier artists that traveled from Indianapolis to Chicago.\u00a0 A critic dubbed the artists in the exhibition The Hoosier Group.\u00a0 Two years later, Adams, Forsyth and Steele along with other artists in the area, formed the Society of Western Artists, the first organization dedicated to promoting the work of the region\u2019s artists.\u00a0 In 1898, Adams and T. C. Steele purchased a house in Brookville, Indiana later known as the Hermitage.\u00a0 In 1901, Adams became one of the first teachers at the newly built John Herron Art Institute where he taught from 1902 to 1906. During the latter part of his life, Adams worked in Florida and Michigan as well as Brookville.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Portraits from the Munich school are usually described in terms such as dark and solemn.\u00a0\u00a0 This description does not fit <em>The Widow, Munich<\/em>, even though the title invokes a sober image.\u00a0 Adams chooses bright tonalities, such as the white bow and hat framing the sitter\u2019s face.\u00a0 Posed in front of a warm green background, the woman looks directly at the viewer with an almost cheerful expression that belies her grievous situation.\u00a0 The large bow echoes the red curve of the sitter\u2019s lips, accentuating her smile.\u00a0 This attractive portrait was probably executed outside the Academy, since it bears little resemblance to the somber study heads produced in the Technical Painting Class.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reference<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Wilbur David Peat. <em>Pioneer Painters of Indiana<\/em>, Indianapolis: Art Association of Indianapolis, Indiana, 1954. \u00a0<strong>ASIN:<\/strong> B0007DFBR2<\/p>",

During his stay in Munich, Bell participated in a number of important exhibitions, including several at the Royal Academy. In 1889, Bell exhibited <em>Lady in Gray<\/em> at the Paris Exposition, which brought him international attention and an award. The painting portrayed a standing woman in a long gown against a softly patterned background. This style of painting would be used often in Bell\u2019s portraits of women from this period. During his lifetime, Bell received great recognition for his work and exhibited at numerous international expositions.<\/p>\n<p><em>Portrait of a Young Woman<\/em> is an essay in subtle earth tones accented by the woman\u2019s long dangling earrings.

Ottis Adams was born in Amity, Indiana and settled with his family in Shelbyville, Indiana.\u00a0 The young Adams was fascinated with art and spent much of his time drawing. He enrolled in Wabash College but left a year later to study art at the South Kensington School in London where he came under the influence of John Constable and Joseph Mallord William Turner, whose landscapes were of particular interest to Adams.\u00a0 He returned to Indiana and settled in Muncie.\u00a0 In 1880, Adams traveled to Munich to study at the Royal Academy with fellow Indiana artists Theodore Clement Steele and Samuel Richards.\u00a0 Adams studied drawing and painting at the Academy and then set up his own studio in Munich.\u00a0 When he returned to Indiana in 1887, Adams set up a studio in Muncie and began teaching art classes.\u00a0 In 1889, he and fellow artist William Forsyth opened the Muncie Art School, which lasted two years. Adams participated in a group show of Hoosier artists that traveled from Indianapolis to Chicago.\u00a0 A critic dubbed the artists in the exhibition The Hoosier Group.\u00a0 Two years later, Adams, Forsyth and Steele along with other artists in the area, formed the Society of Western Artists, the first organization dedicated to promoting the work of the region\u2019s artists.\u00a0 In 1898, Adams and T. C. Steele purchased a house in Brookville, Indiana later known as the Hermitage.\u00a0 In 1901, Adams became one of the first teachers at the newly built John Herron Art Institute where he taught from 1902 to 1906. During the latter part of his life, Adams worked in Florida and Michigan as well as Brookville.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>A key part of the Royal Academy curriculum included copying works by Old Masters at Munich\u2019s art museum, the Alte Penakothek.\u00a0 The Indiana artists made replicas of these works not only as student exercises but also to satisfy the ready market in America for facsimiles of great European masterpieces.\u00a0 Adams financed his trip to Europe by obtaining orders for such copies.\u00a0 This painting was probably made to fulfill part of Adams\u2019 obligation to his Indiana supporters.\u00a0 The artist faithfully transcribed the 17<sup>th<\/sup>-century Spanish painting, only slightly altering the fruit in the lower corner.\u00a0 Since Indiana patrons did not have access to original Old Master paintings, such copies satisfied even the wealthiest collectors.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reference<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Wilbur David Peat. <em>Pioneer Painters of Indiana<\/em>, Indianapolis: Art Association of Indianapolis, Indiana, 1954. \u00a0<strong>ASIN:<\/strong> B0007DFBR2<\/p>",

In 1835 he took up residence in Cincinnati, Ohio. Upon hearing of the plight of northern Indiana\u2019s Potawatomi Indians, who were being removed to Kansas in what became known as \u201cPotawatomi Trail of Death,\u201d Winter settled in Logansport, Indiana, to document their culture.\u00a0 After 13 years in Logansport, he moved to Lafayette, Indiana, and then spent three years in California.\u00a0 Shortly after his return to Indiana in 1876, Winter died suddenly. Although he is known primarily for documenting the relocation of the Potawatomi and Miami tribes, Winter was a writer whose prose not only conveys the anguish of the relocation but also the beauty of the surrounding countryside. Winter is also known for his documentation of the life of Frances Slocum, a Quaker child who was abducted by Indians and later became the wife of the tribe\u2019s chief.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><em>Nocturnal Landscape <\/em>may have been included in one of the lotteries Winter organized each year from 1852 through the 1870s to stimulate his sales.\u00a0 People from as far away as Iowa and New York bought two-dollar lottery tickets in hopes of winning a large painting such as <em>Nocturnal Landscape<\/em>. One of the most effective of Winter\u2019s landscapes, this nighttime setting is unusual among American landscapes of the period.\u00a0 Winter\u2019s gray-blue palette cloaks the Indiana landscape in a Romantic gloom, punctuated by the cool, otherworldly light of the moon and the reassuring glow from the cabin window.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reference<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Kitty Dye. <em>Meet George Winter: Pioneer Artist, Journalist, Entrepreneur<\/em>, St. Louis, Missouri: LeClere Publishing Company, 2001.\u00a0 <strong>ISBN-13:<\/strong> 978-0970250117<\/p>",

Born in Owen County, Steele sought to become a professional artist when few existed in the Midwest and in 1880 traveled to Germany for training at Munich\u2019s Royal Academy of Fine Arts. In 1885, Steele returned to Indiana. The year after completing this 1889 painting, Steele asked an exceptionally high $400 for it in an exhibition and self-published a reproduction in <em>The Steele Portfolio<\/em>. Although these activities alerted art historians to the work\u2019s importance, <em>Morning\u2014Old Schofield\u2019s Mill<\/em> lay hidden in private hands until its donation in 2011.<\/p>\n<p>This 1889 painting bridges the artist\u2019s moody Munich style and the regional Impressionism that marks his later career. <em>Pleasant Run<\/em>, painted just months after Steele\u2019s return to Indiana, shows the technical skill and strong modeling mastered in Munich. In <em>Morning\u2014Old Schofield\u2019s Mill<\/em>, Steele lightened his palette considerably and used a looser brushstroke and palette knife to apply paint. The new brighter color choice and freed paint application peaked in the later <em>The Bloom of the Grape, <\/em>considered the first example of Steele\u2019s Impressionism. Combining strong technical skill with a more personal painting style, the intermediate period of <em>Morning\u2014Old Schofield\u2019s Mill<\/em> is often considered Steele\u2019s strongest.<\/p>",

Treatment undertaken by the IMA conservation department revealed the painting\u2019s original atmospheric color, confirming the work as a transitional keystone between Steele\u2019s Munich and Impressionist periods.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"toc3\">Examination<\/h3>\n<p>Conservation began with a technical examination to gather information about the painting and to design an approach for treatment. The painting was studied using a microscope, as well as under normal, raking, and ultraviolet light. Infrared reflectography and x-radiography were used to reveal changes to the composition, details invisible to the naked eye, or old areas of damage\u2014in this work, a 3\/4-inch tear in the upper left corner and a protrusion at the lower center.<\/p>\n<p>Cleaning tests revealed that the painting was covered with a heavy layer of dirt and soot as well as a yellowed and dirty varnish. The conservator discovered an earlier restoration attempt in which the original dirt, soot, and yellowed varnish were only partially removed and where areas of retouch were applied on top of a few places of damage. The previous restorer also applied varnish over both cleaned and soot-covered areas, complicating the IMA treatment by creating zones requiring different cleaning solutions. During this previous restoration, additional linen lining fabric was unevenly attached to the original canvas to stabilize the two areas of damage.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"toc4\">Treatment<\/h3>\n<p>Working in small sections, the conservator removed the various darkening layers. After lifting the uppermost surface grime with a pH-adjusted aqueous solution, the conservator used mild solvents to remove the restorer\u2019s varnish and small areas of discolored retouch paint.<\/p>\n<p>The conservator then removed the yellowed varnish only to discover another thin dirt layer directly on top of the original paint, suggesting that Steele waited a year before applying his varnish\u2014a recommended but often overlooked practice in oil painting. This thin layer of dirt was carefully removed, unveiling the texture, color-brightness, and atmospheric effects originally intended by Steele. A non-yellowing synthetic varnish was applied on the front of the painting for proper color saturation and surface protection. Lastly, the conservator retouched small areas with easily reversible materials and added a final synthetic varnish. A future step of conservation will undertake the careful removal of the lining canvas added during the previous restoration attempt.<\/p>\n<p>The conservation treatment allows today\u2019s viewers to see <em>Morning\u2014Old Schofield\u2019s Mill<\/em> as it was first exhibited in 1890 by the Art Association of Indianapolis, precursor to the IMA, and will ensure a longer life for this important work.<\/p>\n",
