One of twelve children, Moran left home to work in a cotton factory in Philadelphia, where he also drew large sketches. He and his brother Thomas studied and shared a studio in Philadelphia before returning to England to continue their artistic training. Edward Moran is best known for his marine paintings. His style was influenced by J. M. W. Turner\u2019s seascapes and seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Dutch painting. Although his brother Thomas Moran is the more famous of the two artists, Edward Moran was unequalled during his time as a marine painter.<\/p>\n<p><em>The Valley in the Sea<\/em> is the first and perhaps only panoramic underwater view in nineteenth-century American art. It is most likely that Dr. James M. Sommerville, the original owner of <em>Valley in the Sea<\/em>, commissioned Edward Moran to create this painting, which was executed in Philadelphia. In 1859, Sommerville published <em>Ocean Life<\/em>, which included illustrations of seventy-five different species of aquatic life. In 1860, Matthew Fontaine Maury published <em>The Physical Geography of the Sea and Its Meteorology<\/em>, the first textbook on modern oceanography. There is a marked similarity between some of Maury\u2019s descriptions and Moran\u2019s paintings. A 1971 letter from Jacques Cousteau stated, \u201cEd Moran\u2019s painting \u2026 is a work of imagination, based on serious documentation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Thomas, Tom. <em>Marine Paintings: Edward Moran-Master Painter<\/em>.

In <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imamuseum.org\/art\/collections\/artwork\/american-landscape-hopper-edward\"><em>American Landscape<\/em><\/a> of 1920 Hopper used the railroad tracks to divide the rural foreground with its field of cows from the suburban background suggested by a lone house. The same motif was later explored in paintings such as <em>House by the Railroad<\/em>, 1925; <em>Hills, South Truro<\/em>, 1930; and <em>New York, New Haven, and Hartford<\/em>, 1931.

                    "content": "\r\n<p>\u201cHopper\u2019s scenes initially seem unchanging because of their arrested quality and generally smooth geometric surfaces: he does not depict weathered facades as do Charles Burchfield and Andrew Wyeth. Still, Hopper\u2019s architectural interest illustrates that the buildings of the past, if not the values and way of life, remain for some time. The structures in rural, small-town, and city scenes frequently date from the nineteenth century. In depicting what Lewis Mumford called 'the worst emblems of the period,' Hopper includes a past of dubious achievement, pretension, and bad taste in its imitations of European grandeur. These structures, which intentionally or not reflect America\u2019s cultural confusion, are sometimes made stunning by light and sometimes made touching by their awkwardness: this is the American scene \u2018with its hideous beauty.\u2019 The rural scenes do not feature the details of a particular decade\u2019s architectural mistake; nonetheless, paintings like <em>Hills, South Truro<\/em> (1930) and <em>New York, New Haven, and Hartford<\/em> (1931) are markers of change. The perspective of both and the title of the latter convey the dominance of car and train. The artist does not ascend a summit as a godlike conqueror or visionary poet who would possess material and spiritual values of the prospect. Rather, he is a transient who may not know the people of the place or return again.<\/p>\r\n<p>In these two paintings, the sides and backs of the houses are presented. This may reflect \u2018facts\u2019 of the railroad\u2019s placement, the attempt to cut up the landscape unobtrusively and avoid going through the front yard (as was the case with <em>House by the Railroad<\/em>). The railroad does not obtrude, though. The tracks become prominent and the houses superfluous and displaced. Like Hopper\u2019s human figures, his houses often face away from the viewer and toward the sun\u2014as if involved in a private existence, even transcendence, that can only be witnessed askance. Considered against past American landscapes, this side-view implies a way of life that no longer faces the viewer, who can be engaged in the past and present of the scene only tangentially, almost by accident. Perhaps the triangles and rectangles of buildings set against the irregularity of hillsides attract the eye. There is no representation of practical or overtly moralistic engagement in the scene. Hopper\u2019s farms never seem farmed. Form triumphs, although in such Hopper paintings the form is not exclusively dependent on conceptual reconstruction, as in a cubist exercise. The perspective remains influenced by the position of artist as passenger in a car or train: it is not that of the fl\u00e2neur lost in the crowd, a romantic seeing his own idealism returned, or the poetic farmer attuned to every nuance. It is the view of the traveler who seeks momentary relief from boredom and who finds the landscape familiar, rather like others seen, and impenetrable. Form may triumph in emptying the scene of sentiment and didacticism, but it also empties it of use-value and approachable humanity.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>Paton, Priscilla. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/oclc\/51304032\"><em>Abandoned New England: Landscape in the Works of Homer, Frost, Hopper, Wyeth and Bishop<\/em>.<\/a> New Hampshire: University Press of New England, 2003, pp. 150-151.<\/p>\r\n",

Bishop became part of a group of artists known as the Fourteenth Street School. These artists were influenced by the realism of the Ashcan School. The Fourteenth Street School was comprised of their leader Kenneth Hayes Miller, Reginald Marsh, Bishop, and the brothers Raphael and Moses Soyer. The name of the group derived from their geographical focus on Union Square, which is bordered on its south side by 14<sup>th<\/sup> Street in New York. They painted scenes of daily life in the city, concentrating on individuals from lower socio-economic groups. Isabel Bishop created canvases full of female subjects, like her mentor, Kenneth Hayes Miller, who often painted canvases of female shoppers.<\/p>\n<p>Bishop is best known for her studies of young women in New York caught during idle moments away from their jobs.

In 1905, she enrolled at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and, beginning in 1907, she attended the Art Students League in New York, studying there under William Merritt Chase. Her first art job was as a commercial artist. A drawing class taught by Alon Bement at the University of Virginia Summer School introduced O\u2019Keeffe to the work of Arthur Wesley Dow, whose progressive ideas influenced her art. In 1916, the New York art dealer, Alfred Stieglitz, first exhibited O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s work in his 291 gallery. The two cultivated a relationship and eventually wed in 1924. O\u2019Keeffe began making compositions of enlarged natural forms, which became her signature style. Between 1929 and 1949, O\u2019Keeffe spent each year working in New Mexico and the region influenced her selection of subject matter. After Stieglitz died, O\u2019Keeffe moved to a home she had purchased in Abiquiu, New Mexico. The Georgia O\u2019Keeffe museum was established in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1997, and her home and studio in Abiquiu became a National Historic landmark in 1998.<\/p>\n<p><em>Grey Hills<\/em> was painted during a November trip to a desolate region of New Mexico. The eroded hills and scattered clumps of dry, yellowed sage present a remarkably barren scene, giving the painting a stark, elemental beauty. The softly rounded topography and colored bands of soil form a graceful composition that gradually leads the eye up the massive slope to the top of the canvas. Like the magnified views of O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s flower and bone paintings, the hills of her New Mexico landscapes crowd the frame.<\/p>\n<p>Barbara Buhler Lyons, Leslie Polling-Kempes, Frederick W.

By 1909, he had his first exhibition at Alfred Stieglitz\u2019s New York gallery and he became part of the dealer\u2019s progressive circle of modernists that also included Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, Arthur Dove, and John Marin. He traveled to Europe in 1912, working in Germany under the influence of Expressionism and in Paris, where he met Gertrude Stein and was introduced to some important avant-garde artists. He experimented with Paul C\u00e9zanne\u2019s style of modernism and created numerous still life paintings that focused on decorative elements and structure. Hartley returned to the United States to explore American subject matter. The symbolism and spirituality he found in his subjects became an important part of his life and art, resulting in some of his most powerful paintings. Later in his life, Hartley spent several years in the fishing village at Blue Rocks, Nova Scotia, where he did a series of portraits of the lobstermen. He also painted several religious subjects and returned to still lifes, adding seascape backgrounds.<\/p>\n<p>In the late 1920s, Hartley lived and painted in Aix-en-Provence, the town in southern France where Post-Impressionist Paul C\u00e9zanne spent much of his creative life. There, Hartley painted <em>Melons<\/em>, a still life that reflects his respect for C\u00e9zanne\u2019s methods and approach. While the palette is Hartley\u2019s, the careful, parallel brushstrokes, and the mountainous forms of cloth are indebted to C\u00e9zanne. Hartley\u2019s painting is best appreciated through his statement: \u201cI would rather be sure that I placed two colors in true relationship to each other than to have expressed a wealth of emotionalism gone wrong in the name of richness of personal expression.\u201d <em>Melons<\/em> is a consummation of Hartley\u2019s quest.<\/p>\n<p>Kornhauser, Elizabeth Mankin. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/oclc\/491673265\"><em>Marsden Hartley: American Modernist<\/em>.<\/a> New Haven: Yale University Press, 2003.<\/p>\n",

He studied at the \u00c9cole Bernard Palissy and \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. He earned his money by working for the famous Art Nouveau glass designer, Ren\u00e9 Lalique. Lachaise began to sculpt works inspired by Auguste Rodin. He moved to Boston, and then to New York, where he spent seven years as an assistant to Paul Manship. His full-figured nudes with their small heads and tiny waists became his signature pieces. In the 1920s, Lachaise produced a number of garden sculptures that included dolphins, sea gulls, and fauns.<\/p>\n<p>Like many artists with French roots, Lachaise found inspiration in the circus and its performers. Yet, in the hands of this pioneering modernist, the nimble acrobat becomes another essay in monumental human form. Lachaise\u2019s principal drive as a sculptor was to glorify the sexual and procreative powers of women. In the <em>Acrobat<\/em>, he accentuates male strength and uses the contorted pose to extend his study of bodies in motion. An experienced jewelry and ornament designer, Lachaise effectively contrasted the coppery bronze of the acrobat\u2019s costume with the shiny brass tones of his skin.<\/p>\n<p>Bourgeois, Louise. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/oclc\/191078314\"><em>Gaston Lachiase 1882-1935<\/em>.<\/a> The Lachaise Foundation\/Gallimard, 2009.<\/p>\n",

He trained briefly at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute but was mainly self-taught. Kuhn began his career as a cartoonist before sailing to Europe, where he studied at the Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi in Paris and the Royal Bavarian Academy in Munich. Upon returning to America, he set up a studio in New York City. He became part of a group of artists determined to break away from the constraints of the National Academy of Design, and he helped organize the 1910 Exhibition of Independent Artists. Kuhn was also a founding member of the Association of American Painters and Sculptors, who organized the 1913 Armory Show. In the 1920s, Kuhn was involved with show business, writing and directing vaudeville acts. He also designed costumes. The actors, actresses, showgirls, and clowns were the inspiration for the paintings that became the source of Kuhn\u2019s fame as an artist. Although Kuhn is best known for this subject matter, he also painted still lifes and landscapes.<\/p>\n<p>The 1913 Armory show introduced Kuhn to the work of the French Post-Impressionist Paul C\u00e9zanne. Like C\u00e9zanne\u2019s still lifes, <em>Green Apples with Gray Curtain<\/em> dramatizes commonplace objects in a subtly complex composition. Kuhn transformed a nearly haphazard arrangement of apples into a taut, balanced design, in which the solidly painted apples take on an almost classical dignity. Kuhn reported that color and tonal relationships were difficult for him to master, but in this composition, he achieved a poetic harmony.<\/p>\n<p>Adams, Philip Rhys. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/oclc\/3730353\"><em>Walt Kuhn, Painter: His Life and Work<\/em>.<\/a> Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 1978.<\/p>\n",

                    "content": "\n<p>Paul Manship\u2019s academic career commenced at the St. Paul School of Art in Minnesota. At the age of nineteen, he moved to Philadelphia to continue his studies at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Manship later relocated to New York, where he enrolled at the Art Students League. He also served as an assistant to Solon Borglum, a sculptor of Western themes, from whom he gained knowledge of animal anatomy. Manship won the coveted Prix de Rome and a fellowship to study for three years at the American Academy of Rome. It was at this time that he developed an interest in classical and archaic Greek art. Upon returning to America, these combined influences resulted in a style attractive to both modernists and conservatives in its simplification of line and detail. He created a number of sculptures characterized by a stylized form that was uniquely his own. Manship\u2019s <em>oeuvre<\/em> includes over 700 works.<\/p>\n<p>Manship adapted classical sources for his interpretation of the myth of Europa. Taking the form of a bull, Zeus abducted Europa and carried her on the back of dolphins to the Island of Crete, where she bore Minos, Rhadamanthys, and Sarpedon. The muscular bull derives from ancient Minoan forms, while the maiden\u2019s stylized hair and posture were inspired by Archaic Greek models. Never has there been a more poised victim than Manship\u2019s Europa, riding backwards as she listens to Eros\u2019s whisper. The forms are smooth and simplified, and the rhythmic composition balances horizontal and vertical, as well as speed and stillness.<\/p>\n<p>Rathner, Susan. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/oclc\/25711168\"><em>Archaism, Modernism, and the Art of Paul Manship<\/em>.<\/a> Austin: University of Texas Press, 1993.<\/p>\n",

Born in North Kingston, Rhode Island, and raised in Newport, Stuart was taught by a local Scottish painter, who took him to Scotland. His mentor\u2019s death forced Stuart to return to America. During the Revolutionary War, Stuart traveled to England to study with the American expatriate Benjamin West. As success came, so did debt, which forced Stuart to Dublin, Ireland, and then to America, where he eventually became the most highly regarded portraitist of his day. A skillful master of his craft, Stuart painted directly on the canvas without using any preliminary drawing. Stuart was prolific \u2013 he painted over one thousand portraits of important political figures. One of his most famous portraits of George Washington was the \u201cAthenaeum Head,\u201d which is currently on the dollar bill.<\/p>\n<p>The portrait of Marianne Ashley Walker exemplifies Stuart\u2019s ability to endow his sitters with character and elegance. The velvet-draped column and serene pose are standard conventions of portraiture at that time, but Stuart\u2019s particular gifts shine forth from her exquisitely rendered flesh and lifelike eyes. Stuart has seized upon the young woman\u2019s dignified beauty, drawing her poise and confidence to an expressive point that stops short of arrogance or disdain. Marianne Ashley Walker was the daughter of John Ashley of Philadelphia. In 1799, she married Simon Walker in Philadelphia. The portrait is thought to have been painted on the occasion of her wedding. The companion portrait of her husband is in the collection of the Baltimore Museum.<\/p>\n<p>Barratt, Carrie Rebora and Ellen Gross Miles. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/oclc\/55286303\"><em>Gilbert Stuart<\/em>.<\/a> New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2004.<\/p>\n",

Peale received his first painting lessons from John Hesselius and later, he studied with Benjamin West in London. He settled in Philadelphia after serving in the Continental Army from 1775-1778. Numerous revolutionary heroes, including George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin, sat for his portraits. Peale married three times and fathered seventeen children, some of whom became important artists, including his sons Raphaelle, James, Rembrandt, Rubens, Franklin, and Titian Ramsay Peale. This dynasty of painters produced portraits, still lifes, and landscape paintings. Peale was not only one of the country\u2019s foremost artists, but he was also a harness maker, upholsterer, watch and clock maker, sign painter, silversmith, scientist, inventor, taxidermist and archeologist.<\/p>\n<p>Charles Peale Polk was Peale\u2019s orphaned nephew. Polk trained under his uncle, and he earned a living as a portraitist and commercial sign painter. He specialized in portraits of notable military and political figures. Polk often copied these portraits to sell for additional income. He also made over fifty copies after Peale\u2019s portrait of George Washington.<\/p>\n<p>The execution of <em>George Washington at Princeton<\/em> was likely a collaborative endeavor with the senior artist responsible for the sitter\u2019s head and chest only. Washington\u2019s dignified appearance bears resemblance to Peale\u2019s \u201cConstitutional Convention\u201d portrait, painted from life in 1787, and on which a popular print was based. This scene, however, shows General Washington in his Continental Army uniform standing before Princeton, New Jersey, where the Revolutionary army won a victory in 1777. Polk repeated the Princeton portrait numerous times with little variation.<\/p>\n<p>Crocker, Linda. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/oclc\/7703535\"><em>Charles Peale Polk 1786-1882: A Limner and His Likenesses<\/em>.<\/a> Washington, D.

He moved to Cincinnati in 1837, worked with his brother-in-law as a house painter, and taught himself to paint portraits and landscapes. He experimented with daguerreotypes in Indianapolis, opened a portrait studio in Charlestown, West Virginia, and then returned to Cincinnati. Beginning in 1843, he devoted himself to landscape painting. Through the efforts of wealthy Cincinnati art patron Nicholas Longworth, Whittredge was able to study for five years in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, a major European art center at this time. He never officially enrolled at the D\u00fcsseldorf Academy; however, he studied with several teachers, who encouraged him to base his landscapes on <em>plein-air<\/em> sketches.<\/p>\n<p><em>Summer Pastorale<\/em> derives from studies made in Central Germany. The painting is probably a compilation of two views recorded in sketches and skillfully joined in the final composition by the band of trees at mid-canvas. It was painted for E. J. Mathews of Cincinnati in the style of Whittredge\u2019s teacher Johann Schirmer, the leader of the D\u00fcsseldorf landscape school. Noteworthy is the play of light throughout the landscape, which captures the atmosphere of a summer day. Whittredge recalled, \u201cMy summers were spent in Westphalia, in the Harz Mountains or in the more immediate neighborhood of D\u00fcsseldorf.\u201d Much of the work Whittredge sent back to Cincinnati contained motifs from these travels, especially his trips to the Harz Mountains in late summer 1852, or the dramatic landscape near Kallenfels in the Nahe Valley.<\/p>\n<p>Janson, Anthony F. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/oclc\/19922732\"><em>Worthington Whittredge<\/em>.<\/a> New York: Cambridge University Press, 1990.<\/p>\n",

He eventually settled in Pennsylvania, where he studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts under William Merritt Chase. He was awarded a fellowship, which allowed him to study in England, France, and Italy. When he returned in 1909, he became a faculty member of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, teaching painting and drawing for the next forty-one years. Garber was known as one of the leaders of the Pennsylvania Impressionists, or the New Hope School, as the group was called. He depicted the quarries, woods, and Delaware River Valley of Bucks County, Pennsylvania. His home near Lumberville was not far from the great stone quarries at Byram, New Jersey, which he often painted. Like most Impressionists, Garber painted out of doors directly from nature. These patterned scenes were dominated by shades of blue, green, and yellow. His work earned gold medals and numerous awards and prizes.<\/p>\n<p><em>Quarry at Byram<\/em> exemplifies Garber\u2019s painting of these excavations. He recreates their raw, craggy surfaces with great deliberation, devoting his Impressionist sensibilities to the play of light across the Pennsylvania soil. Garber infused the setting with his own lyrical approach to the American landscape, achieving a subtle balance between the cliff\u2019s massive volume and its rich surface properties.<\/p>\n<p>Humphries, Lance. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/oclc\/70062981\"><em>Daniel Garber: His Life and Work<\/em>.<\/a> New York: Hollis Taggart Galleries, 2006.<\/p>\n<p>Peterson, Brian H. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/oclc\/49936175\"><em>Pennsylvania Impressionism<\/em>.<\/a> Philadelphia: James A Michener Art Museum and University of Pennsylvania Press, 2002.<\/p>\n",

Hilliard left Indiana after 1876 and studied and worked in Europe, primarily England, Scotland and France. Hilliard was known for his New England landscapes and coastal scenes, which resemble the Hudson River School in their romantic realism. Sometime after returning to New York from Europe Hilliard added floral subjects to his landscape work. Hilliard ultimately settled in Washington, D.

While in Paris, he was influenced by the Synchronist school of painting, which took an abstract approach to color to express emotion and mood. Benton eventually rejected modernism in the early 1920s and adopted a style that was called Regionalism. His approach contained familiar scenes and characters from small-town life in Middle America. Benton\u2019s technique consists of undulating, rhythmic lines and vibrant colors. He painted numerous murals of American life; one of his most important mural commissions is the <em>Social History of Indiana<\/em> at Indiana University. Benton\u2019s goal was to produce a uniquely American art that focused on the Heartland. In addition to painting, Benton taught at the Art Students League in New York, where Jackson Pollock was one of his students. In 1935, Benton became the director of the Kansas City Art Institute and School of Design.<\/p>\n<p>In <em>Henry Look Unhitching<\/em>, the fertile earth and cloud filled sky are drawn with rhythmic curving lines that suggest the vitality of the forces of nature. The dynamism of the landscape, however, is subdued by the reverie of the stooped farmer, who unhitches his horse after a day\u2019s work.<\/p>\n<p>Dennis, James M. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/oclc\/36446938\"><em>Renegade Regionalists: The Modern Independence of Grant Wood, Thomas Hart Benton, and John Steuart Curry<\/em>.<\/a> Milwaukee: University of Wisconsin Press, 1998.<\/p>\n<p>Foster, Kathleen A., Nanette E.

He also attended the Art Students League of New York. He toured Europe for six years, painting in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, England, and Italy. While abroad, Marin developed an interest in watercolors inspired by the work of James Abbott McNeill Whistler. Dealer and colleague Alfred Stieglitz, a champion of modernism, gave Marin his first one-man exhibition in New York. The association between Stieglitz and Marin lasted nearly forty years. Stieglitz\u2019s gallery exhibitions introduced Marin to Cubism and German Expressionism, which helped him develop his compositions.<\/p>\n<p>Marin\u2019s art displayed sensitivity to nature\u2019s rhythms. The dynamic application of impasto suggests the turbulence of the sea in <em>Hurricane<\/em>. Marin painted this canvas from his summer home on the coat of Maine, but his sense of wind, water, and clouds is not tied to any specific locale. When Mrs. Fesler purchased <em>Hurricane<\/em>, Stieglitz wrote congratulating her on the acquisition: \u201cThe <em>Hurricane<\/em> is certainly a masterpiece, Every one agrees with every one else as to that\u2026.You will realize more and more as you will live with the Marins what they signify \u2013 Endless wonder.
