It looks like an ancient and mysterious ritual object, yet it is cast in industrial-grade glass, which places it in our technological age. The glass is both translucent and reflective, which allows the work to respond to its environment. <em>Second Vase<\/em> is a masterpiece of restraint-the rough glass and its imperfections countered by the sculpture's ideal proportions, the interior of its neck embellished with gold leaf. It belongs to a series based upon vessel forms. Ben Tr\u00e9 has said of the works of this series that \"there are always two cavities or hollows which never connect. This separation speaks to me of the disconnect that exists between the sexual, spiritual, and intellectual aspects of ourselves.\"<\/p>\n<p>Ben Tr\u00e9's sculptures begin as gestural drawings, which he develops into full-scale models made of cardboard and polystyrene. The casting process, which involves repeatedly heating and cooling the glass within a sand-and-resin mold, can take two months. The works are finished in Ben Tr\u00e9's Pawtucket, Rhode Island, studio, where they may be enriched with materials such as bronze powder or gold leaf.<\/p>\n<p><em>Second Vase<\/em> is part of the Marilyn and Eugene Glick Collection of contemporary studio glass, one of the nation's most extensive, which includes works by many leading American and European artists.<\/p>\n<blockquote><em>He is engaged in inventing the forms of an imagined civilization, which has discovered how to mold glass.<\/em><br \/>-Critic Arthur Danto, 1999<\/blockquote>",

He was brought up in the world of Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach by his mother, who conducted the symphony orchestra in Covington. In 1912, Savage won the coveted <em>Prix de Rome<\/em> and spent three years in Italy at the American Academy, immersing himself in the study of Renaissance artists and mural paintings. He returned to America to paint Renaissance-inspired murals during the Roaring Twenties. A member of the Yale University faculty, Savage was considered the most successful of the Rome-trained academicians, and he received numerous public commissions. His interest centered chiefly on the field of mural painting, where his influence was greatest.<\/p>\n<p><em>Bacchanal<\/em> typifies the decorative quality of Savage\u2019s style and his superb craftsmanship. Like most of his compositions, it is an allegory. In the foreground, Autumn, wearing a wreath of leaves, pulls Summer from the scene. Winter, represented by an old man holding a shaft, casually prepares to shoot Autumn, as Spring pulls on his beard in her attempt to supersede Winter. With the circular pattern of action, the unusual texture created by the gold leaf, and the stylized treatment of the figures, this painting is a reminder of the persistence of the decorative and academic spirit in America.<\/p>\n<p>Kammin, Michael. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/oclc\/52553978\"><em>A Time to Every Purpose: The Four Seasons in American Culture<\/em>.<\/a> Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 2003.<\/p>\n",

At this time, Ritman came under the influence of the American Impressionists Richard Miller and Frederick Frieseke. He was particularly inspired by their paintings of women in domestic interiors and garden settings. Their approach differed from the previous artists who resided in Giverny because they focused on figure painting over landscapes. A popular subject included women relaxing in their boudoirs or in sunlit gardens. By the summer of 1913, Ritman was producing images of nude and partially draped figures.<\/p>\n<p>In <em>Sunlit Window<\/em>, the floral prints of the wallpaper, curtains, and model\u2019s blouse co-exist with the potted plant leaves and the emphatic stripes of the venetian blinds and table legs. The orderly patterns contrast abruptly with the buzzing confusion of nature seen through the open window. The striking difference between the style of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imamuseum.org\/art\/collections\/artwork\/early-morning-sunshine-ritman-louis\"><em>Early Morning Sunshine<\/em><\/a> (IMA) and <em>Sunlit Window<\/em> is due to Ritman\u2019s contact with the artist Frederick Frieseke, leader of the Giverny Group, who achieved fame with his use of strong, colorful decorative patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Love, Richard H. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/oclc\/16900948\"><em>Louis Ritman: From Chicago to Giverny<\/em>.<\/a> Chicago: Haase Mumm Publishing Company.<\/p>\n",

Marsh also worked in the art departments of <em>Vanity Fair<\/em> and the New York <em>Daily News<\/em>. He studied in Paris for a year in 1925. After receiving a tutorial from Thomas Hart Benton in 1929, he adopted egg tempera and used this medium continuously throughout the 1930s. Marsh was an urban realist, who depicted society\u2019s lower class. A prolific printmaker, he created 236 etchings, lithographs, and engravings. Marsh was a member of a small group of artists, which included Isabel Bishop, Moses and Raphael Soyer, and their teacher Kenneth Hayes Miller. The group\u2019s name, the Fourteenth Street School, derived from their focus on scenes of daily life around Union Square on 14<sup>th<\/sup> Street in New York, which was also the site of the Art Students League.<\/p>\n<p>The headline and title of the topical painting <em>Hauptmann Must Die<\/em> refer to the judgment passed on the convicted kidnapper of Charles Lindbergh\u2019s baby. Each figure is sharply delineated in this painting of the dingy waiting room at Pennsylvania Station in 1935. Drawing was always foundational in Marsh\u2019s methodology. He employed a graphic style, which individualized nameless travelers in its adherence to detail.

Lawrence presents an intimate but unsentimental picture of poverty and overcrowded conditions in the slums.

Many of his teachers were black artists. His primary teacher was Charles Alston at the Harlem Art Workshop. A social realist painter early in his career, Lawrence found the subject for much of his work in black history and through his observations of daily life. Born in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Lawrence grew up in Harlem, in New York City, which provided material for many of his paintings. Lawrence often painted in series, such as his famous <em>The Migration of the Negro<\/em>, comprising 60 paintings. This series made the 24-year-old Lawrence an immediate success. Lawrence became one of America\u2019s most honored painters. He had exhibits in major museums, received honorary doctorates, won prizes and foundations grants, and was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the National Council of the Arts and the National Academy of Design. In 1990, President George Bush gave Lawrence a National Medal of Arts. Lawrence attributed his success to his heritage. From his early years, he chronicled his personal experience as a black man and the historical struggles of African Americans in his paintings of slave revolts, ghetto life, discrimination, and the devastation of war. Lawrence\u2019s paintings mix humor with adversity and offer hope for the future of African Americans.<\/p>\n<p><em>The Birth<\/em>, a Depression-era scene of a tenement house in Harlem, exemplifies Lawrence\u2019s interest in depicting African American history and contemporary life. Here, the artist used flat, simplified forms and geometric patterns derived from Cubism. Lawrence\u2019s small format presents the viewer with an intimate picture of the overcrowded conditions in the tenement houses and the poverty of its inhabitants.<\/p>\n<p>Nesbitt, Peter T. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/oclc\/45193323\"><em>The Complete Jacob Lawrence<\/em>.<\/a> Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2000.<\/p>\n<p>Wheat, Ellen Harkin. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/oclc\/13330584\"><em>Jacob Lawrence: American Painter<\/em>.<\/a> Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2000, reprinted from 1986 original.<\/p>\n",
