At this time, Ritman came under the influence of the American Impressionists Richard Miller and Frederick Frieseke. He was particularly inspired by their paintings of women in domestic interiors and garden settings. Their approach differed from the previous artists who resided in Giverny because they focused on figure painting over landscapes. A popular subject included women relaxing in their boudoirs or in sunlit gardens. By the summer of 1913, Ritman was producing images of nude and partially draped figures.<\/p>\n<p><em>Early Morning Sunshine<\/em> shows an attractive woman, probably the artist\u2019s favorite model, Mimi, seated on the ledge of an open window that reveals a backdrop of brilliant foliage. The composition is executed using broken color in a harmonious balance of blues, pinks, lavenders, and yellows. Painted in a fluid and delicate manner, this intimate interior is typical of the artist\u2019s early Giverny canvases.<\/p>\n<p>Love, Richard H. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/oclc\/16900948\"><em>Louis Ritman: From Chicago to Giverny<\/em>.<\/a> Chicago: Haase Mumm Publishing Company.<\/p>\n",
