Philadelphia was the largest city in the American colonies, and a tremendous housing boom was fueling an explosion in the demand for furniture. Philadelphia\u2019s cosmopolitan residents were aware of the latest styles from abroad, especially the work of the English cabinetmaker Thomas Chippendale, who in 1754 had published a hugely successful book of his furniture patterns titled The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker\u2019s Director. Chippendale\u2019s designs were very influential in the colonies, but growing political tensions with England obliged Philadelphians to purchase furniture from local makers, who adapted Chippendale\u2019s patterns to suit the tastes and traditions of their American clients. <p>\n<p>The tallboy, a long-legged chest of drawers used to store clothing and table linens, became very popular during this period. With its high scroll pediment, flame finials, and shell motifs, this piece is a prime example of the preeminent Philadelphia type. It is a gift of the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in the State of Indiana, whose numerous donations have enriched the IMA\u2019s collection of American decorative arts.<p>",
