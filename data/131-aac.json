The first machine for manufacturing chain mail was developed by the factory in 1907; soon it was mass producing great quantities of mesh items, purse accessories and jewelry. Whiting and Davis products are distinguished from lesser imitators by the high quality of their design: even such sophisticated Europeans as Paul Poiret, the Parisian couturier and interior designer, were commissioned to furnish designs for Whiting and Davis handbags. The well-known geometric, stylized patterns on many Whiting Davis purses often executed in vivid colors help to convey to the present-day viewer something of the flavor of the \u201cjazz age.\u201d<\/p>",

The first machine for manufacturing chain mail was developed by the factory in 1907; soon it was mass producing great quantities of mesh items, purse accessories and jewelry. Whiting and Davis products are distinguished from lesser imitators by the high quality of their design: even such sophisticated Europeans as Paul Poiret, the Parisian couturier and interior designer, were commissioned to furnish designs for Whiting and Davis handbags. The well-known geometric, stylized patterns on many Whiting Davis purses often executed in vivid colors help to convey to the present-day viewer something of the flavor of the \u201cjazz age.\u201d<\/p>",

In 1905, she enrolled at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and, beginning in 1907, she attended the Art Students League in New York, studying there under William Merritt Chase. Her first art job was as a commercial artist. A drawing class taught by Alon Bement at the University of Virginia Summer School introduced O\u2019Keeffe to the work of Arthur Wesley Dow, whose progressive ideas influenced her art. In 1916, the New York art dealer, Alfred Stieglitz, first exhibited O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s work in his 291 gallery. The two cultivated a relationship and eventually wed in 1924. O\u2019Keeffe began making compositions of enlarged natural forms, which became her signature style. Between 1929 and 1949, O\u2019Keeffe spent each year working in New Mexico and the region influenced her selection of subject matter. After Stieglitz died, O\u2019Keeffe moved to a home she had purchased in Abiquiu, New Mexico. The Georgia O\u2019Keeffe museum was established in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1997, and her home and studio in Abiquiu became a National Historic landmark in 1998.<\/p>\n<p><em>In Pelvis with Distance<\/em>, an enormous skeletal form rises majestically from the flat foreground. In the distance, a mountain range defines a low horizon line. O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s radical distortion of scale and perspective is striking in this painting. The foreground is dominated by the bone\u2019s elegant contours, exemplifying O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s genius for capturing the essential forms of nature. O\u2019Keeffe wrote to collector Caroline Marmon Fesler about her bone series, \u201cIt is a kind of thing that I do that makes me feel I am going off into space \u2013 in a way that I like \u2013 and that frightens me a little because it is so unlike what anyone else is doing \u2013 I always feel that sometime I may fall off the edge \u2013 it is something I like so much to do that I don\u2019t care if I do fall off the edge.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lyons, Barbara Buhler, Leslie Polling-Kempes, and Frederick W.

Born in North Kingston, Rhode Island, and raised in Newport, Stuart was taught by a local Scottish painter, who took him to Scotland. His mentor\u2019s death forced Stuart to return to America. During the Revolutionary War, Stuart traveled to England to study with the American expatriate Benjamin West. As success came, so did debt, which forced Stuart to Dublin, Ireland, and then to America, where he eventually became the most highly regarded portraitist of his day. A skillful master of his craft, Stuart painted directly on the canvas without using any preliminary drawing. Stuart was prolific \u2013 he painted over one thousand portraits of important political figures. One of his most famous portraits of George Washington was the \u201cAthenaeum Head,\u201d which is currently on the dollar bill.<\/p>\n<p>The conventional pose and accessories in <em>Portrait of a Young Woman<\/em> are characteristic of Stuart\u2019s work; however, the sitter\u2019s rare loveliness and the influence of French Neoclassicism are exceptional.

Shaw immigrated to Philadelphia in 1817 to oversee the installation of Benjamin West\u2019s painting <em>Christ Healing the Sick<\/em> at the Pennsylvania Hospital. In 1819, he traveled with his teenage son to the South to create watercolor scenes of the area that were engraved in acquaint and published as a book, <em>Picturesque Views of American Scenery<\/em> (1820-1821). After returning to Philadelphia, Shaw created over two hundred oil paintings.<\/p>\n<p>The <em>Pioneers<\/em> exemplifies the picturesque aesthetic popular among English artists during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth-centuries. The shadowy valley, rugged woodcutters, and twisted trees exhibit striking contrasts of light and dark, rough textures, and intricate forms. Shaw\u2019s scene may be based on the topography of Pennsylvania\u2019s Delaware Water Gap.

He was strongly influenced by the intimate interiors of seventeenth-century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. Portraiture and figure studies were Paxton\u2019s specialty. He was also noted for his depictions of upper class life. A consummate draftsman and colorist, Paxton was adept at depicting flesh convincingly. Paxton described his technique, \u201cI let the surfaces flow into one another in a supple envelope of light and paint.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>Glow of Gold, Gleam of Pearl<\/em> is the masterpiece of Paxton\u2019s early career. A transitional work, it predates most of the elegant domestic scenes for which he is best known. The figure\u2019s silhouette and theatrical pose are reminiscent of Jean L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me\u2019s academic paintings, which Paxton would have seen during his training with G\u00e9r\u00f4me in Paris. Instead of the smooth, idealizing finish characteristic of French nudes, this figure is brushed with a modified impressionist flourish. The model\u2019s ruddy complexion captured as a reflection on the nearby walls give her flesh a sensuous realism.<\/p>\n<p>Lee, Ellen Wardwell, R. H. Ives Gammel, Martin F.

At the age of nineteen, he moved to Philadelphia to continue his studies at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Manship later relocated to New York, where he enrolled at the Art Students League. He also served as an assistant to Solon Borglum, a sculptor of Western themes, from whom he gained knowledge of animal anatomy. Manship won the coveted Prix de Rome and a fellowship to study for three years at the American Academy of Rome. It was at this time that he developed an interest in classical and archaic Greek art. Upon returning to America, these combined influences resulted in a style attractive to both modernists and conservatives in its simplification of line and detail. He created a number of sculptures characterized by a stylized form that was uniquely his own. Manship\u2019s <em>oeuvre<\/em> includes over 700 works.<\/p>\n<p>Venus\u2019s birth from sea foam, called <em>Venus Anadyomene<\/em>, is the subject depicted here.  The cascade of wavy hair and the figure\u2019s soft, rounded forms are congruent with images of the sea, the goddess, and the Art Deco style. Manship lavished attention on the surfaces of his sculpture. Here, the rich brown coloring has been rubbed away from her hair to add highlights.<\/p>\n<p>Rathner, Susan. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/oclc\/25711168\"><em>Archaism, Modernism, and the Art of Paul Manship<\/em>.<\/a> Austin: University of Texas Press, 1993.<\/p>\n",

Ramos builds on a tradition of depicting the idealized female nude that dates back to 19th century French salon painting and its predecessors. Intentionally humorous, his works draw on depictions of women from popular culture, such as pin-up calendars, centerfolds and advertisements. He emphasizes these sources by endowing his painted figures with the characteristic sheen of commercial photography, and emphasizing their self-consciously come-hither glances to the viewer. Because of his references to popular culture, his work has been associated with the Pop Art movement that dominated much of the art world in the mid-1960s.<\/p>",
