In this densely patterned ceremonial rattle, a figure receives spiritual power from a raven through the medium of a frog that he holds in his mouth. The bird's tail doubles as a handle, once bound by a strap. The bottom of the rattle depicts an unidentified totem painted with green, black, and red pigments. The spiritual nature of the carvings is certain, though the precise purposes of individual rattles in relation to the animals depicted are hard to decipher: this one might depict a shaman receiving poison from the mouth of a frog or visionary prowess from a bird of prey. The intricacy of the openwork carving, sculpted from a single piece of wood, mirrors the complex relationship among the animals and the human figures.<\/p>\n<p>A shaman would use the rattle's rasping sounds to harness spirits, perhaps while performing a healing dance around a patient, or at the abundant gift-giving feast known as the potlatch. Masks, charms, batons, and boxes are other ritual instruments that reinforce the inherited right to certain songs, ceremonies, animal crests, and names.<\/p>\n<blockquote><em>Laugh at the chief!

By 1855, Groshon was living with an adopted niece but no wife, so if Mrs. John Groshon did indeed quilt this quilt, she perhaps died by that time. The style of quilt was in favor in the first part of the 19th century, so it is unlikely that it was made after 1850. There are still questions about the identity of the maker and the date. Evidence of Groshon's marriage\/wife have not yet been found.",

These quilts almost always consisted of two layers of fabric sewn together without any interlining (batting. The top layer was the finest kind of white cotton fabric one could find, and the bottom layer usually was a homespun, loosely woven white cotton or linen fabric. Only an expert needleworker could do the fine and intricate stitching required to execute the sophisticated patterns. Fine running stitches were used to embroider the pattern onto the two layers of fabric. The sculptured, high relief effect of these quilts was achieved by stuffing cotton or cording through openings made in the loosely woven backing farbic. After the desired three-dimensional effect was achieved, the threads in the open areas were sewn shut.<\/p>\n<p>Because of the degree of refinement and fine stitching required, trapunto quilts were among the most difficult execute successfully. This quilt, which is only partially stuffed, has a framed medallion depicting the princess feather pattern and cornucopias overflowing with flowers. The wide border is filled with designs of leaves, flowers, grapevines and princess plumes.<\/p>",
