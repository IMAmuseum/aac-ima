Now, there\u2019s a difference being an illustrator (and he made his living that way and it must have caused him untold private agony). But, for him to use the real stuff of the world and somehow\u2014not suddenly but painstakingly, painfully, slowly\u2014figure out how to stack the elements into a heap that began talking very tellingly of his own deepest inner feelings, he had to make some kind of marriage between what he could see outside with his eyes, touch with his hands, and the feelings that were going on inside. Now, I think that\u2019s as simply as I can say what I think art is about. Take, for example, the drawing for <em>Hotel Lobby<\/em> and the painting. The drawing he obviously did in his notebook while standing in a hotel lobby. There\u2019s an entire series of subtle shifts, changes, that I think are equivalent to all the shifts and changes that go on in the most sophisticated Cubist paintings by Picasso or Braque, shifts and changes that Hopper made in order to arrive at an architecture and internal state of mind, which I like enormously.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Levin, Gail. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/776568\">\u201cArtists\u2019 Panel: Joel Meyerowitz, George Segal, William Bailey,\u201d<\/a> <em>Art Journal<\/em> 41 (Summer 1981): 151, fig. 1.<\/p>\n",

                    "content": "\n<p>\u201cOn January 4, 1943, Hopper delivered to the Rehn Gallery a new oil painting, which provides mute evidence that the armistice of late summer held. Jo (Hopper\u2019s wife and muse) struck poses for each of the two female figures and marshaled an array of props. The seated matron with the piercing glance wears a plumed hat, fur coat, scarlet dress with a blue brooch, and sensible shoes on firmly planted feet. The younger blond woman, reading, wears a blue dress cut to above her elbows and knees, baring her arms and long legs that extend relaxed, slightly crossed, to feet scarcely wrapped in flimsy straps and balanced casually on spike heels.<\/p>\n<p>For Jo there was plenty to do, since Edward made at least ten preparatory sketches and the attitudes and dress of the women figure largely. As he had for <em>Nighthawks<\/em>, Edward altered the sketches in the final work to emphasize separateness. Sketches show the matron in colloquy with her elegant male companion, but on the canvas the two look apart. A sketch shows a seated man gazing across the hotel lobby. In the painting, seated in his place, the young woman regards her book.<\/p>\n<p>Also as in <em>Nighthawks<\/em>, architecture frames a scene in which light picks out figures theatrically and implies potential drama: there the two men in their respective detachments from the lurid woman, here the nuanced styles, postures, and positions of the two women in relation to the imposing male. The architecture and dress in <em>Nighthawks<\/em> are plebeian, street vernacular, suggesting the kind of place in which the Hoppers habitually ate. Hopper endows the hotel with an architecture ornately classical, fluted columns and ionic capitals, and his figures are of commensurate class, more like the world of Rehn\u2019s clients, Hopper\u2019s collectors, or the uncomfortable hotels on the trips to jury various shows when the tab was paid by the host. The fur coat was Jo\u2019s, both a recurrent prop in the pictures and a fixture at the grand museum openings she loved. Filling out this scene of power and patronage, the picture framed in ornate gold on the wall depicts what Hopper himself refused to paint in the West\u2014the heroic peaks and valleys captured by Bierstadt and others, which this context represents as a clich\u00e9. Identifying human restlessness with the American push for change, Hopper presents the hotel as a typical American building, as James had written in <em>The American Scene<\/em>: \u2018a synonym for civilization, \u2026the American spirit most seeking and most finding itself.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Levin, Gail. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/oclc\/255565073\"><em>Edward Hopper:  An Intimate Biography<\/em>.<\/a> New York: Rizolli, 2007,  pp. 358-359, 383.<\/p>\n",
