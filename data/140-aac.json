Pratt Fund<\/p>\n<p><strong>Learn More<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>William Merritt Chase was born in Ninevah, Indiana and studied under Barton Hayes in Indianapolis and then briefly at the National Academy of Design.\u00a0 Due to the interest and generosity of several art patrons, Chase was able to take a five-year trip to Munich, where he studied at the city\u2019s Royal Academy.\u00a0 In 1878, Chase returned to New York City, opened his Tenth Street Studio and developed his signature impressionist style.\u00a0 He was a member of America\u2019s influential group of impressionists known as The Ten, but was also an extremely influential teacher.\u00a0 Chase opened the first summer school of landscape painting at his summer home in Shinnecock, Long Island.\u00a0 He also taught at the Chase School in New York, which he founded, and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.\u00a0 His students included such famous artists as Marsden Hartley, Charles Demuth, Edward Hopper, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe and Charles Sheeler.<\/p>\n<p>When Chase painted this portrait of his grandfather, he was no more than eighteen years old and Moses Swaim just over seventy.\u00a0 Young Chase had only recently begun studying with Indianapolis artist Barton Hays, but his likeness convincingly portrays the rugged features and earnest expression of this agricultural pioneer.\u00a0 The tightly brushed portrait is one of Chase\u2019s earliest canvases. It descended in the artist\u2019s family, surviving a house fire and a long period in a Kansas drug store.\u00a0 When it entered the IMA, the image was marred by soot, small holes and an improperly fitted frame.\u00a0 After treatment in the museum\u2019s laboratory and careful reframing, Chase\u2019s grandfather now reveals the startlingly early prowess of his portraiture.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reference<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ronald G.

Moving into the realm of sculpture, he created open-form, welded-metal constructions inspired in part by the Cubist and Surrealist sculpture that Pablo Picasso and Julio Gonz\u00e1lez created in the early 1930s.<\/p>\n<p>Around 1938, Smith started making silver castings, beginning with a group of small medallions. In 1954, the same year that he contributed work to the exhibition <em>Sculpture in Silver from Islands in Time,<\/em> Smith created <em>Egyptian Barnyard<\/em>-the first silver casting that he made for himself and displayed in his home. Smith titled the work after he completed it, perhaps alluding to the central form, which resembles an Egyptian mummy.<\/p>\n<p>Born in Decatur, Indiana, Smith lived in the Midwest until he was twenty-one. In 1929, he started visiting Bolton Landing, New York, on the hills overlooking Lake George. He moved there permanently in 1940 and named his studio Terminal Iron Works. Although best known for his large-scale steel sculptures, which are often described as drawings in space, Smith also produced paintings and drawings that demonstrate a close connection to his three-dimensional work. Seven of Smith's drawings are in the IMA collection.<\/p>\n<blockquote><em>[It is] a good sculpture and the only one I'll probably ever make with such delicacy.<\/em><br \/>-David Smith, 1957<\/blockquote>",

Widely associated with Abstract Expressionism, Smith considered his raw materials and forceful welding process to be primary aspects of his work. In this sculpture, the artist welded and soldered sterling silver just as he would with iron or steel, not treating it as a precious metal.<\/p>",
